Sixth Exercise (Error Handling)
=================================================

Please complete the following steps:

1. Use **"sentigator"** server code and add handler for logging uncaught exceptions of the application

2. Add Domain execution context to our **"sentigator"** server

3. There are still EventEmitter errors that we can handle - add the missing error handlers

#####Use the **"sentiment"** and the **"sentigator"** modules in this repository as a starting point for the exercise
